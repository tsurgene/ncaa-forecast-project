This repo is a **MSDS 565** group final project repository to hold all files for using predictive modeling to forecast the 2023 NCAA Mens and Womens Basketball Tournaments. The project code may also serve as submission for the *Kaggle* team competition.


For running the Ridge Regression, Logistic Regression and SVM models, we used the datasets in the "data" folder. These data sets were developed using the process outlined in the "Creating the training set - FINAL" notebook.
