    "The evaluation methodology for 2023 has changed from prior editions of this competition. Submissions are now evaluated on the **Brier score** between the predicted probabilities and the actual game outcomes (this is equivalent to mean squared error in this context). This change was made to reduce the competitive \"distractions\" caused by the 0 and 1 boundaries of the previous log-loss metric (e.g. submitting rounded predictions to gamble on a given upset, or caring deeply about the 0.99 vs 0.999 distinction that log loss would reward/punish).\n",

    "**Submission File**\n",
    "\n",
    "The submission file format also has a revised format for 2023:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Kaggle has combined the Men's and Women's tournaments into one single competition.** Our submission file should contain predictions for both.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **We will be predicting the hypothetical results for every possible team matchup, not just teams that are selected for the NCAA tournament.** This change was enacted to provide a longer time window to submit predictions for the 2023 tournament. Previously, the short time between Selection Sunday and the tournament tipoffs would require participants to quickly turn around updated predictions. By forecasting every possible outcome between every team, we can now submit a valid prediction at any point leading up to the tournaments.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We are allowed as many predictions as we wish before the tournaments start, but **must select no more than two submissions we want to count towards scoring in the Kaggle competition**. Do not rely on automatic selection to pick your submissions, as there is no public leaderboard score and the system will select your earliest two submissions.\n"
